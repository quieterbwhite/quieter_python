# Nero's Voice  - Manage time

```
Ladies and gentlemen,
 I'M BACK! Yeah~
 after all that long, 
we finally meet up here again. 
Did you miss me?
 Tell me you missed me! 
Alright, I'm just joking.
 But I'm not kidding on this one, alright?  
I missed you guys so much~ 

The Spring Festival was in three weeks ago, 
I don't know whether you kept learning during the time or not, 
but I do know that my weight increased in a large scale.
Oh, that's probably a sad story to the best of us.
But, it's a good news for me, cause I planned to put more on weight in year 2016, 
and finally I did at the very end. 

Among all those plans we made however,  I don't really think that many of us eventually achieved it. 
So, what's the matter that we can't even stick to the plan.
Ok, I'm gonna tell you something about how to make an achievable plan. 
Let's check it out together~ 
And see you the same time here on next Wednesday, 
bye bye~
