# job interview english

```
Hi, every one. I'm Jade.

What we're talking about today is job interview English. So,

in this lesson, I'm going to give you some phrases that you can use in a job interview,

and I'll also be giving you...

we'll also be looking at what grammer you should be using.

to answer common job interview questions.

So I'm going to break it down so you know what to expect when you have that job interview in English,

maybe for the first time, or maybe you've already had a couple of interviews in English but you just

want to improve your performance.

So, let's start by talking about before the inerview.

So, when you get there, there's always, like, that bit of small talk.

maybe you find it awkward, maybe you're a pro at small talk,

but I thought I'd just give you some phrases so that you've got something to say. at least.

So, when you get there,

It's polite to say something like:

"Thanks for inviting me to inerview."

If you feel like initiating small talk,

you could say something like:

"Is the position based in this office?" or "building"

whereever you are.

You might also want to say:

"Oh, how many people work here?"

Just sort of general things,

nothing personal going on there.
